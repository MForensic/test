The pseudocode below serves as our specification for the implementation of pipelined Fast-HotStuff based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11454.pdf. 

Types
----
A ```block``` has the following fields:
+ ```parent```
+ ```view```
+ ```qc```
+ ```agg_qc```
+ ```signature```
+ ```transactions```

A ```vote``` has the following fields:
+ ```block```
+ ```signer```
+ ```signature```

A ```new_view``` message has the following fields:
+ ```view```
+ ```high_qc```
+ ```signer```
+ ```signature```

A ```qc``` has the following fields:
+ ```block```
+ ```signers```
+ ```signature```

An ```agg_qc``` has the following fields:
+ ```view```
+ ```qcs```
+ ```signers```
+ ```signature```

Variables
----
Every node keeps track of its local
+ ```cur_view```
+ ```high_qc```
+ ```final_block```

Prerequisites
----
The functions defined in the next section rely on primitives we do not specify in detail for the sake of brevity: 
+ ```leader(view)``` returns the leader of the view
+ ```supermajority(signers)``` returns whether the signers represent the supermajority
+ ```reset()``` restarts the timer which calls timeout when it expires
+ ```download(hash)``` and ```download(view)``` fetches a missing block from peer nodes
+ ```extends(block, ancestor)``` returns whether there is a chain between the block and the ancestor
+ ```commit(ancestor, block)``` commits the descendants of ancestor along the chain to the block
+ ```sign(message)``` creates a bls signature on the message using the node's private key
+ ```aggregate(signatures)``` aggregates the bls signatures and returns the resulting signature
+ ```verify(message, signature, signers)``` verifies if the (aggregated) bls signature on the message corresponds to the public key(s) of the signer(s)
+ ```batch_verify(messages, signature, signers)``` batch verifies if the aggregated bls signature on the messages corresponds to the public key of the signers

Functions
----
The following pseudocode specifies the core functionality of correct nodes. To ease legibility, we deviate from the Python syntax to some extent.
